CVE-2023-49735,N/A,"** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED **

The value set as the DefaultLocaleResolver.LOCALE_KEY attribute on the session was not validated while resolving XML definition files, leading to possible path traversal and eventually SSRF/XXE when passing user-controlled data to this key. Passing user-controlled data to this key may be relatively common, as it was also used like that to set the language in the 'tiles-test' application shipped with Tiles.

This issue affects Apache Tiles from version 2 onwards.

(One might use cp when configuring access control, such as with the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.)
