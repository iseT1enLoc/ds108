CVE-2023-31290,N/A,"Trust Wallet Core before 3.1.1, as used in the Trust Wallet browser extension before 0.0.183, allows theft of funds because the entropy is 32 bits, as exploited in the wild in December 2022 and March 2023. This occurs because the mt19937 Mersenne Twister takes a single 32-bit value as an input seed, resulting in only four billion possible mnemonics. The affected versions of the browser extension are 0.0.172 through 0.0.182. To steal funds efficiently, an attacker can identify all Ethereum addresses created since the 0.0.172 release, and check whether they are Ethereum addresses that could have been created by this extension. To respond to the risk, affected users need to upgrade the product version and also move funds to a new wallet address.",5.9,0.53%,2023-04-27,2025-01-30
CVE-2023-31287,N/A,An issue was discovered in Serenity Serene (and StartSharp) before 6.7.0. Password reset links are sent by email. A link contains a token that is used to reset the password. This token remains valid even after the password reset and can be used a second time to change the password of the corresponding user. The token expires only 3 hours after issuance and is sent as a query parameter when resetting. An attacker with access to the browser history can thus use the token again to change the password in order to take over the account.,7.8,0.06%,2023-04-27,2025-01-31
CVE-2023-31286,N/A,"An issue was discovered in Serenity Serene (and StartSharp) before 6.7.0. When a password reset request occurs, the server response leaks the existence of users.

The resulting link can be sent to an administrator user.",6.1,0.61%,2023-04-27,2025-01-31
