CVE-2016-10072,N/A,"WampServer 3.0.6 has two files called 'wampmanager.exe' and 'unins000.exe' with a weak ACL for Modify. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. To properly exploit this vulnerability, the local attacker must insert an executable file called wampmanager.exe or unins000.exe and replace the original files. The next time one of these programs is launched by a more privileged user, malicious code chosen by the local attacker will run. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report, taking the position that a configuration in which ""'someone' (an attacker) is able to replace files on a PC"" is not ""the fault of WampServer.",7.5,0.11%,2016-12-27,2024-08-06
CVE-2016-10045,N/A,The isMail transport in PHPMailer before 5.2.20 might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between the escapeshellarg function and internal escaping performed in the mail function in PHP. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2016-10033.,9.8,93.79%,2016-12-30,2021-09-30
CVE-2016-10041,N/A,"An issue was discovered in Sprecher Automation SPRECON-E Service Program before 3.43 SP0. Under certain preconditions, it is possible to execute telegram simulation as a non-admin user. As prerequisites, a user must have created an online-connection, validly authenticated and authorized as administrator, and executed telegram simulation. After that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.",7.5,0.56%,2016-12-25,2017-01-07

CVE-2016-10031,N/A,"WampServer 3.0.6 installs two services called 'wampapache' and 'wampmysqld' with weak file permissions, running with SYSTEM privileges. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.
