CVE-2017-1002153,N/A,"Koji 1.13.0 does not properly validate SCM paths, allowing an attacker to work around blacklisted paths for build submission.",7.5,0.35%,2017-10-06,2023-03-01
CVE-2017-1000383,N/A,"GNU Emacs version 25.3.1 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a backup save file (""[ORIGINAL_FILENAME]~"") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the emacs binary.",5.5,0.04%,2017-10-31,2017-11-27
CVE-2017-1000382,N/A,"VIM version 8.0.1187 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a swap file (""[ORIGINAL_FILENAME].swp"") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the vi binary.",5.5,0.06%,2017-10-31,2017-11-27
CVE-2017-1000257,N/A,"An IMAP FETCH response line indicates the size of the returned data, in number of bytes. When that response says the data is zero bytes, libcurl would pass on that (non-existing) data with a pointer and the size (zero) to the deliver-data function. libcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes strlen() on the data to figure out the length. The strlen() is called on a heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after (or just crash) and then deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded.",9.1,0.93%,2017-10-31,2018-11-13
CVE-2017-1000256,N/A,"libvirt version 2.3.0 and later is vulnerable to a bad default configuration of ""verify-peer=no"" passed to QEMU by libvirt resulting in a failure to validate SSL/TLS certificates by default.",8.1,0.23%,2017-10-31,2020-11-16
CVE-2017-1000255,N/A,"On Linux running on PowerPC hardware (Power8 or later) a user process can craft a signal frame and then do a sigreturn so that the kernel will take an exception (interrupt), and use the r1 value *from the signal frame* as the kernel stack pointer. As part of the exception entry the content of the signal frame is written to the kernel stack, allowing an attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations with arbitrary values. The exception handling does produce an oops, and a panic if panic_on_oops=1, but only after kernel memory has been over written. This flaw was introduced in commit: ""5d176f751ee3 (powerpc: tm: Enable transactional memory (TM) lazily for userspace)"" which was merged upstream into v4.9-rc1. Please note that kernels built with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=n are not vulnerable.",6.6,0.05%,2017-10-30,2018-04-11
CVE-2017-1000254,N/A,"libcurl may read outside of a heap allocated buffer when doing FTP. When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.",7.5,1.48%,2017-10-06,2021-06-29
CVE-2017-1000253,N/A,"Linux distributions that have not patched their long-term kernels with https://git.kernel.org/linus/a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (committed on April 14, 2015). This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the ""gap"" between the stack and the binary.",7.8,63.38%,2017-10-05,2025-01-22

CVE-2017-1000117,N/A,"A malicious third-party can give a crafted ""ssh://..."" URL to an unsuspecting victim, and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any program that exists on the victim's machine being executed. Such a URL could be placed in the .gitmodules file of a malicious project, and an unsuspecting victim could be tricked into running ""git clone --recurse-submodules"" to trigger the vulnerability.",8.8,70.19%,2017-10-05,2019-10-03

CVE-2017-1000114,N/A,"The Datadog Plugin stores an API key to access the Datadog service in the global Jenkins configuration. While the API key is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the API key for example through browser extensions or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The Datadog Plugin now encrypts the API key transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.",4.3,0.03%,2017-10-05,2017-10-17
CVE-2017-1000113,N/A,"The Deploy to container Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration. This allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access, or users with Extended Read access to the jobs it is used in, to retrieve those passwords. The Deploy to container Plugin now integrates with Credentials Plugin to store passwords securely, and automatically migrates existing passwords.",5.5,0.02%,2017-10-05,2019-06-11
CVE-2017-1000112,N/A,"Linux kernel: Exploitable memory corruption due to UFO to non-UFO path switch. When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in e89e9cf539a2 (""[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach"") on Oct 18 2005.",7.0,80.68%,2017-10-05,2023-06-07
CVE-2017-1000111,N/A,"Linux kernel: heap out-of-bounds in AF_PACKET sockets. This new issue is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further. As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.",7.8,0.10%,2017-10-05,2023-01-17
CVE-2017-1000110,N/A,"Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. It did not properly check the current user's authentication and authorization when configuring existing GitHub organization folders. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to reconfigure it, including changing the GitHub API endpoint for the organization folder to an attacker-controlled server to obtain the GitHub access token, if the organization folder was initially created using Blue Ocean.",4.3,0.04%,2017-10-05,2019-10-03

CVE-2017-1000108,N/A,"The Pipeline: Input Step Plugin by default allowed users with Item/Read access to a pipeline to interact with the step to provide input. This has been changed, and now requires users to have the Item/Build permission instead.",7.5,0.09%,2017-10-05,2017-11-01
CVE-2017-1000107,N/A,"Script Security Plugin did not apply sandboxing restrictions to constructor invocations via positional arguments list, super constructor invocations, method references, and type coercion expressions. This could be used to invoke arbitrary constructors and methods, bypassing sandbox protection.",8.8,0.29%,2017-10-05,2019-10-03
CVE-2017-1000106,N/A,"Blue Ocean allows the creation of GitHub organization folders that are set up to scan a GitHub organization for repositories and branches containing a Jenkinsfile, and create corresponding pipelines in Jenkins. Its SCM content REST API supports the pipeline creation and editing feature in Blue Ocean. The SCM content REST API did not check the current user's authentication or credentials. If the GitHub organization folder was created via Blue Ocean, it retained a reference to its creator's GitHub credentials. This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to create arbitrary commits in the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder with the GitHub credentials of the creator of the organization folder. Additionally, users with read access to the GitHub organization folder could read arbitrary file contents from the repositories inside the GitHub organization corresponding to the GitHub organization folder if the branch contained a Jenkinsfile (which could be created using the other part of this vulnerability), and they could provide the organization folder name, repository name, branch name, and file name.",8.5,0.03%,2017-10-05,2019-10-03
