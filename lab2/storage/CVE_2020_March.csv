CVE-2020-11106,N/A,"An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In the dialog.php page, the session variable $_SESSION['RF'][""view_type""] wasn't sanitized if it was already set. This made stored XSS possible if one opens ajax_calls.php and uses the ""view"" action and places a payload in the type parameter, and then returns to the dialog.php page. This occurs because ajax_calls.php was also able to set the $_SESSION['RF'][""view_type""] variable, but there it wasn't sanitized.",6.1,0.29%,2020-03-30,2020-04-01
CVE-2020-11105,N/A,"An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0. It employs caching of std::shared_ptr values, using the raw pointer address as a unique identifier. This becomes problematic if an std::shared_ptr variable goes out of scope and is freed, and a new std::shared_ptr is allocated at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes dependent upon memory layout. In short, serialized std::shared_ptr variables cannot always be expected to serialize back into their original values. This can have any number of consequences, depending on the context within which this manifests.",9.8,0.33%,2020-03-30,2020-04-01
CVE-2020-11104,N/A,"An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0.
