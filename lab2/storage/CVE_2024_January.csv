CVE-2024-24747,N/A,"MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage. When someone creates an access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only for `s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless somewhere above in the access-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are denied, access keys will be able to simply override their own `s3` permissions to something more permissive. The vulnerability is fixed in RELEASE.2024-01-31T20-20-33Z.",8.8,4.48%,2024-01-31,2024-02-09
CVE-2024-24736,N/A,"The POP3 service in YahooPOPs (aka YPOPs!) 1.6 allows a remote denial of service (reboot) via a long string to TCP port 110, a related issue to CVE-2004-1558.",7.5,0.54%,2024-01-29,2024-02-02
CVE-2024-24579,N/A,"stereoscope is a go library for processing container images and simulating a squash filesystem.  Prior to version 0.0.1, it is possible to craft an OCI tar archive that, when stereoscope attempts to unarchive the contents, will result in writing to paths outside of the unarchive temporary directory. Specifically, use of `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory()` function, the  `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider` struct, or the higher level `github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read()` function express this vulnerability. As a workaround, if you are using the OCI archive as input into stereoscope then you can switch to using an OCI layout by unarchiving the tar archive and provide the unarchived directory to stereoscope.",9.8,0.34%,2024-01-31,2024-02-09
CVE-2024-24573,N/A,"facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind. In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, when a user updates their profile, a POST request containing user information is sent to the endpoint server/fm-modules/facileManager/ajax/processPost.php. It was found that non-admins can arbitrarily set their permissions and grant their non-admin accounts with super user privileges.",8.8,0.25%,2024-01-31,2024-02-07
CVE-2024-24572,N/A,"facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind. In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql
variable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.",6.5,0.47%,2024-01-31,2024-02-07
CVE-2024-24571,N/A,"facileManager is a modular suite of web apps built with the sysadmin in mind. For the facileManager web application versions 4.5.0 and earlier, we have found that XSS was present in almost all of the input fields as there is insufficient input validation.",5.4,0.45%,2024-01-31,2024-02-07
CVE-2024-24567,N/A,"Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin raw_call even if the call is a delegatecall or a staticcall. But in the context of delegatecall and staticcall the handling of value is not possible due to the semantics of the respective opcodes, and vyper will silently ignore the value= argument. If the semantics of the EVM are unknown to the developer, he could suspect that by specifying the `value` kwarg, exactly the given amount will be sent along to the target. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.",5.3,0.20%,2024-01-30,2024-02-06
CVE-2024-24566,N/A,"Lobe Chat is a chatbot framework that supports speech synthesis, multimodal, and extensible Function Call plugin system. When the application is password-protected (deployed with the `ACCESS_CODE` option), it is possible to access plugins without proper authorization (without password). This vulnerability is patched in 0.122.4.",5.3,0.17%,2024-01-31,2024-02-09
CVE-2024-24565,N/A,"CrateDB is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze massive amounts of data in real-time. There is a COPY FROM function in the CrateDB database that is used to import file data into database tables. This function has a flaw, and authenticated attackers can use the COPY FROM function to import arbitrary file content into database tables, resulting in information leakage. This vulnerability is patched in 5.3.9, 5.4.8, 5.5.4, and 5.6.1.",6.5,41.68%,2024-01-30,2024-02-05
CVE-2024-24558,N/A,"TanStack Query supplies asynchronous state management, server-state utilities and data fetching for the web.  The `@tanstack/react-query-next-experimental` NPM package is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. To exploit this, an attacker would need to either inject malicious input or arrange to have malicious input be returned from an endpoint. To fix this issue, please update to version 5.18.0 or later.",8.2,0.54%,2024-01-30,2024-04-23
CVE-2024-24556,N/A,urql is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks.  The `@urql/next` package is vulnerable to XSS. To exploit this an attacker would need to ensure that the response returns `html` tags and that the web-application is using streamed responses (non-RSC). This vulnerability is due to improper escaping of html-like characters in the response-stream. To fix this vulnerability upgrade to version 1.1.1,7.2,0.45%,2024-01-30,2024-02-06
