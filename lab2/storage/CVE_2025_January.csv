CVE-2025-24891,Directory traversal,"Dumb Drop is a file upload application. Users with permission to upload to the service are able to exploit a path traversal vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary system files. As the container runs as root by default, there is no limit to what can be overwritten. With this, it's possible to inject malicious payloads into files ran on schedule or upon certain service actions. As the service is not required to run with authentication enabled, this may permit wholly unprivileged users root access. Otherwise, anybody with a PIN.",9.6,0.12%,2025-01-31,2025-01-31
CVE-2025-24886,N/A,"pwn.college is an education platform to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. Incorrect symlink checks on user specified dojos allows for users (admin not required) to perform an LFI from the CTFd container.

CVE-2025-24814,N/A,"Core creation allows users to replace ""trusted"" configset files with arbitrary configuration

Solr instances that (1) use the ""FileSystemConfigSetService"" component (the default in ""standalone"" or ""user-managed"" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual ""trusted"" configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as ""trusted"" and can use ""<lib>"" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from ""FileSystemConfigSetService"").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of ""<lib>"" tags by default.",5.4,0.08%,2025-01-27,2025-02-15

CVE-2025-24802,N/A,"Plonky2 is a SNARK implementation based on techniques from PLONK and FRI. Lookup tables, whose length is not divisible by 26 = floor(num_routed_wires / 3) always include the 0 -> 0 input-output pair. Thus a malicious prover can always prove that f(0) = 0 for any lookup table f (unless its length happens to be divisible by 26). The cause of problem is that the LookupTableGate-s are padded with zeros. A workaround from the user side is to extend the table (by repeating some entries) so that its length becomes divisible by 26. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.0.1.",8.6,0.02%,2025-01-30,2025-01-30
