CVE-2025-30153,N/A,"kin-openapi is a Go project for handling OpenAPI files. Prior to 0.131.0, when validating a request with a multipart/form-data schema, if the OpenAPI schema allows it, an attacker can upload a crafted ZIP file (e.g., a ZIP bomb), causing the server to consume all available system memory. The root cause comes from the ZipFileBodyDecoder, which is registered automatically by the module (contrary to what the documentation says). This vulnerability is fixed in 0.131.0.",7.5,N/A,2025-03-19,2025-03-19
CVE-2025-30152,N/A,"The Syliud PayPal Plugin is the Sylius Core Teamâ€™s plugin for the PayPal Commerce Platform. Prior to 1.6.2, 1.7.2, and 2.0.2, a discovered vulnerability allows users to modify their shopping cart after completing the PayPal Checkout process and payment authorization. If a user initiates a PayPal transaction from a product page or the cart page and then returns to the order summary page, they can still manipulate the cart contents before finalizing the order. As a result, the order amount in Sylius may be higher than the amount actually captured by PayPal, leading to a scenario where merchants deliver products or services without full payment. The issue is fixed in versions: 1.6.2, 1.7.2, 2.0.2 and above.",6.5,N/A,2025-03-19,2025-03-19
CVE-2025-30144,N/A,"fast-jwt provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to 5.0.6, the fast-jwt library does not properly validate the iss claim based on the RFC 7519. The iss (issuer) claim validation within the fast-jwt library permits an array of strings as a valid iss value. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a JWT with an iss claim structured as ['https://attacker-domain/', 'https://valid-iss']. Due to the permissive validation, the JWT will be deemed valid. Furthermore, if the application relies on external libraries like get-jwks that do not independently validate the iss claim, the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to forge a JWT that will be accepted by the victim application. Essentially, the attacker can insert their own domain into the iss array, alongside the legitimate issuer, and bypass the intended security checks. This issue is fixed in 5.0.6.",6.5,N/A,2025-03-19,2025-03-19
CVE-2025-30143,N/A,Rule 3000216 (before version 2) in Akamai App & API Protector (with Akamai ASE) before 2024-12-10 does not properly consider JavaScript variable assignment to built-in functions and properties.,5.4,0.03%,2025-03-17,2025-03-17
CVE-2025-30142,N/A,"An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. Bypassing of Device Pairing can occur. It uses MAC address verification as the sole mechanism for recognizing paired devices, allowing attackers to bypass authentication. By capturing the MAC address of an already-paired device through ARP scanning or other means, an attacker can spoof the MAC address and connect to the dashcam without going through the pairing process. This enables full access to the device.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30141,N/A,"An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. One can Remotely Dump Video Footage and the Live Video Stream. It exposes API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092 that allow remote access to recorded and live video feeds. An attacker who connects to the dashcam's network can retrieve all stored recordings and convert them from JDR format to MP4. Additionally, port 9092's RTSP stream can be accessed remotely, allowing real-time video feeds to be extracted without the owner's knowledge.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30140,N/A,"An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. A Public Domain name is Used for the Internal Domain Name. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. This domain was not owned by GNET originally, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic (it has since been registered by the vulnerability discoverer). If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30139,N/A,"An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. Default credentials for SSID cannot be changed. It broadcasts a fixed SSID with default credentials that cannot be changed. This allows any nearby attacker to connect to the dashcam's network without restriction. Once connected, an attacker can sniff on connected devices such as the user's smartphone. The SSID is also always broadcasted.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30138,N/A,"An issue was discovered on G-Net Dashcam BB GONX devices. Managing Settings and Obtaining Sensitive Data and Sabotaging Car Battery can be performed by unauthorized persons. It allows unauthorized users to modify critical system settings once connected to its network. Attackers can extract sensitive car and driver information, mute dashcam alerts to prevent detection, disable recording functionality, or even factory reset the device. Additionally, they can disable battery protection, causing the dashcam to drain the car battery when left on overnight. These actions not only compromise privacy but also pose potential physical harm by rendering the dashcam non-functional or causing vehicle battery failure.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30137,N/A,"An issue was discovered in the G-Net GNET APK 2.6.2. Hardcoded credentials exist in in APK for ports 9091 and 9092. The GNET mobile application contains hardcoded credentials that provide unauthorized access to the dashcam's API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092. Once the GNET SSID is connected to, the attacker sends a crafted authentication command with TibetList and 000000 to list settings of the dashcam at port 9091. There's a separate set of credentials for port 9092 (stream) that is also exposed in cleartext: admin + tibet. For settings, the required credentials are adim + 000000.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30132,N/A,"An issue was discovered on IROAD Dashcam V devices. It uses an unregistered public domain name as an internal domain, creating a security risk. During analysis, it was found that this domain was not owned by IROAD, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic. If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30123,N/A,"An issue was discovered on ROADCAM X3 devices. The mobile app APK (Viidure) contains hardcoded FTP credentials for the FTPX user account, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized access and extract sensitive recorded footage from the device.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30122,N/A,"An issue was discovered on ROADCAM X3 devices. It has a uniform default credential set that cannot be modified by users, making it easy for attackers to gain unauthorized access to multiple devices.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30117,N/A,"An issue was discovered on the Forvia Hella HELLA Driving Recorder DR 820. Managing Settings and Obtaining Sensitive Data and Sabotaging the Car Battery can be performed by unauthorized parties. After bypassing the device pairing, an attacker can obtain sensitive user and vehicle information through the settings interface. Remote attackers can modify power management settings, disable recording, delete stored footage, and turn off battery protection, leading to potential denial-of-service conditions and vehicle battery drainage.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30116,N/A,"An issue was discovered on the Forvia Hella HELLA Driving Recorder DR 820. Remotely Dumping of Video Footage and the Live Video Stream can occur. It allows remote attackers to access and download recorded video footage from the SD card via port 9091. Additionally, attackers can connect to port 9092 to stream the live video feed by bypassing the challenge-response authentication mechanism. This exposes sensitive location and personal data.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30115,N/A,"An issue was discovered on the Forvia Hella HELLA Driving Recorder DR 820. Default Credentials Cannot Be Changed.

The SSID is continuously broadcast, allowing unauthorized access to the device network.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
CVE-2025-30114,N/A,"An issue was discovered on the Forvia Hella HELLA Driving Recorder DR 820. Bypassing of Device Pairing can occur. The pairing mechanism relies solely on the connecting device's MAC address. By obtaining the MAC address through network scanning and spoofing it, an attacker can bypass the authentication process and gain full access to the dashcam's features without proper authorization.",N/A,N/A,2025-03-18,2025-03-18
