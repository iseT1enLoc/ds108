CVE-2024-39469,N/A,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix nilfs_empty_dir() misjudgment and long loop on I/O errors

The error handling in nilfs_empty_dir() when a directory folio/page read
fails is incorrect, as in the old ext2 implementation, and if the
folio/page cannot be read or nilfs_check_folio() fails, it will falsely
determine the directory as empty and corrupt the file system.

In addition, since nilfs_empty_dir() does not immediately return on a
failed folio/page read, but continues to loop, this can cause a long loop
with I/O if i_size of the directory's inode is also corrupted, causing the
log writer thread to wait and hang, as reported by syzbot.

Fix these issues by making nilfs_empty_dir() immediately return a false
value (0) if it fails to get a directory folio/page.",N/A,0.23%,2024-06-25,2024-07-05
