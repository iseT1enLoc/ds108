CVE-2018-1000007,N/A,"libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header value. Sending the same set of headers to subsequent hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.",9.8,3.07%,2018-01-24,2022-06-13
CVE-2018-1000006,N/A,"GitHub Electron versions 1.8.2-beta.3 and earlier, 1.7.10 and earlier, 1.6.15 and earlier has a vulnerability in the protocol handler, specifically Electron apps running on Windows 10, 7 or 2008 that register custom protocol handlers can be tricked in arbitrary command execution if the user clicks on a specially crafted URL. This has been fixed in versions 1.8.2-beta.4, 1.7.11, and 1.6.16.",9.3,93.16%,2018-01-24,2018-04-01
CVE-2018-1000005,N/A,"libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.",9.1,0.36%,2018-01-24,2019-06-18
CVE-2018-1000004,N/A,"In the Linux kernel 4.12, 3.10, 2.6 and possibly earlier versions a race condition vulnerability exists in the sound system, this can lead to a deadlock and denial of service condition.",7.1,1.72%,2018-01-16,2020-07-15
CVE-2018-1000003,N/A,Improper input validation bugs in DNSSEC validators components in PowerDNS version 4.1.0 allow attacker in man-in-the-middle position to deny existence of some data in DNS via packet replay.,4.3,0.02%,2018-01-22,2018-02-06

CVE-2018-1000001,N/A,In glibc 2.26 and earlier there is confusion in the usage of getcwd() by realpath() which can be used to write before the destination buffer leading to a buffer underflow and potential code execution.,7.8,44.76%,2018-01-31,2019-10-03
CVE-2018-6480,N/A,"A type confusion issue was discovered in CCN-lite 2, leading to a memory access violation and a failure of the nonce feature (which, for example, helped with loop prevention). ccnl_fwd_handleInterest assumes that the union member s is of type ccnl_pktdetail_ndntlv_s. However, if the type is in fact struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s or struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s, the memory at that point is either uninitialised or points to data that is not a nonce, which renders the code using the local variable nonce pointless. A later nonce check is insufficient.",8.8,0.40%,2018-01-31,2018-02-21
